for adding milestones, 

I would do add a model called task_milestones

rails g model task_milestones title:string priority:integer task_item_id:references

Model schema would be 
title - string 
priority - integer 
task_list - referenced 

ordering by priority

Associations would be 

milestones belongs to task_list 
milestones belong to user through task_list
task_list has many milestones

form.erb.html 

adding a milestone
    - have text file for title
    - have select from 1 - 5 for priority 

milestone.erb.html
display a milestone
it would be in same list with a heading of milestones under task_items 

it would have controller actions of 

create 

edit / update 

destroy 

and be similar to those of task_items
